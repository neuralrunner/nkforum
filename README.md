# NK-Forum
A Project of a Course Forum based uppon (Alura's Forum), using SpringBoot, SpringData, Spring Security, Bean Validation, Actuator, Swagger2, Authorization with JWT Token(with JJWT) and other Spring technologies.
W.I.P., I'll be posting the documentation and other assets when it's done.

## Documentation with SpringFoxSwagger2
/swagger-ui.html
*Remember to include Bearer in front of the Header for Token JWT, otherwise you might get a 403.

## Actuator on Spring Boot Admin
The application is ready to provide information for a Spring Boot Admin application for monitoring reasons.
You may want to download/clone this project [actuator-admin](https://github.com/neuralrunner/actuator-admin) as well, to monitor this one.
